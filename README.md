# websockets

A little websockets example, previewing the upcoming nodejs codegen. This ended up being more complicated of an example than I wanted to use for official docs, so I'm just pushing it up as a reference

Note: I have `dfx-dev` aliased to the build directory of https://github.com/dfinity/sdk.
